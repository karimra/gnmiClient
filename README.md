gNMI CLI client that provides full support for Capabilities, Get, Set and Subscribe RPCs.

Documentation available at [https://gnmiclient.kmrd.dev](https://gnmiclient.kmrd.dev)

## Features
* **Full support for gNMI RPCs**  
  Every gNMI RPC has a [corresponding command](https://gnmiclient.kmrd.dev/basic_usage/) with all of the RPC options configurable by means of the local and global flags.
* **Multi-target operations**  
  Commands can operate on multiple gNMI targets for bulk configuration/retrieval.
* **File based configuration**  
  gNMI Client understands configurations provided in a file. The configuration options are consistent with the CLI flags.
* **Inspect gNMI messages**  
  With the `textproto` output you can see the actual gNMI messages being sent/received. Its like having a gNMI looking glass!
* **(In)secure gRPC connection**  
  gNMI client supports both TLS and non-TLS transports so you can start using it in a lab environment without having to care about the PKI.
* **Dial-out telemetry**  
  The dial-out telemetry server is provided for Nokia SR OS.
* **Pre-built multi-platform binaries**  
  gNMI Client is available for major operating systems and the [installation](https://gnmiclient.kmrd.dev/install/) is a breeze.
* **Extensive and friendly documentation**  
  You won't be in need to dive into the source code to understand how to use the gNMI CLI client, our [documentation site](https://gnmiclient.kmrd.dev) has you covered.
